AppleSeeds Heros - One day group assignment   11/05/2022


Fetch – like yesterday's StarWars – 2 API requests/ saving the data into Object
The second fetch stage will be via loop. The loop will also render the "person" divs – IF SUCCESSFUL.
Each person object will be kept within "person array", and will contain the DOM element.
For "search" or "filter" – we can empty the DOM from all the person divs, map or filter the persons array and re-render only the relevant DOM element from each person filtered.

Delete – remove the DOM element and remove from the persons array
Edit – re-render the person div – replacing the <p> with <input> (with the original data as value)
Whether – looping over all the people, listing all the citys. Then fetching from whether API.
Updating every time the user edit a city

Instructions
We will create a table of data we get from the following
API
calls:
Instructions
1. Test the api calls with postman
2. Create an editable table with the data you are getting.
(It can be an actually table or use flex-box, each to their
own).
3. Create a button that can remove the row from your UI.
4. Create a button that can edit your row. Once you click
on the button the data (without the id cell) will turn into a
input field and then the button edit and delete will
change to cancel and confirm.
Will a click on the cancel button all the changes I put in
the input field will be revered.
If you click on the confirm button the data will change.
